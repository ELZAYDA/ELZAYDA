## ⚡ Fun Fact
*Here's a funny story from my coding journey! 😄
During my first year in college, I had a computer-based quiz on problem-solving. I had practiced extensively on Codeforces and solved those problems multiple times - I was confident! But when the quiz started, I completely froze up and couldn't solve anything (maybe someone jinxed me! 😅).
That embarrassing moment actually became my motivation! Instead of giving up, it pushed me to dive deeper into problem-solving. I ended up solving over 200 problems on various platforms. Sometimes our worst moments become our biggest motivators! 🚀*
